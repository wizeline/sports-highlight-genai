Purpose:
This module contains utility functions that provide common and reusable functionalities across the project. These helper functions aim to simplify repetitive tasks and improve code readability by providing standardized solutions.

Guidelines for Developers:
- Add functions that perform general tasks which can be used in multiple parts of the project.
- Ensure that functions in this module are well-documented and tested.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility to maintain clarity and ease of use.
- If a function becomes too specific or complex, consider refactoring or moving it to a more appropriate module.

Examples of common utilities might include functions for data validation, file operations, or string manipulations.

Usage:
Import this module in other parts of the project as needed to use the provided utility functions. For example:
    from src.utils.helpers import function_name
